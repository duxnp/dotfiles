            If `check` is true, and the process exits with a non-zero exit
            code, a CalledProcessError exception will be raised. Attributes of
            that exception hold the arguments, the exit code, and stdout and
            stderr if they were captured.

            If `capture_output` is true, stdout and stderr will be captured.

            If `cwd` is not None, the function changes the working directory to
            `cwd` before executing the child. `cwd` can be a string, bytes or
            path-like object. In particular, the function looks for executable
            (or for the first item in args) relative to `cwd` if the executable
            path is a relative path.
